## 👋 欢迎来到Convenient MCL社区！
  我们利用[`Github Discussions`](https://docs.github.com/cn/discussions)来把这里改造成一个讨论平台:
  * 问一些你不太确定的问题
  * 分享你的主意
  * 鼓励其他社区创作者投入[`Convenient MCL`](https://github.com/CMCL-Developing/CMCL-Windows)的开发。
  * 欢迎其他人。记住：这是一个属于开发者们的讨论社区 💪.
另外说一句，[`Convenient MCL`](https://github.com/CMCL-Developing/CMCL-Windows)将对积极[`Pull Request`](https://github.com/CMCL-Developing/CMCL-Windows/pulls) & [`Issue`](https://github.com/CMCL-Developing/CMCL-Windows/issues) & [`Discuss`](https://github.com/CMCL-Developing/CMCL-Windows/discussions)的同志们一些惊喜！

  For the maintainers, here are some tips 💡 for getting started with Discussions. We'll leave these in Markdown comments for now, but feel free to take out the comments for all maintainers to see.

  📢 **Announce to your community** that Discussions is available! Go ahead and send that tweet, post, or link it from the website to drive traffic here.

  🔗 If you use issue templates, **link any relevant issue templates** such as questions and community conversations to Discussions. Declutter your issues by driving community content to where they belong in Discussions. If you need help, here's a [link to the documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#configuring-the-template-chooser).

  ➡️ You can **convert issues to discussions** either individually or bulk by labels. Looking at you, issues labeled “question” or “discussion”.
